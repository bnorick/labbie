--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Labbie is a tool to help you determine which bases to use for each enchant in the Eternal Labyrinth.

Features include:
- Manual lookup for enchants and bases
- Screen capture lookup for enchants at the end of Lab
- Summary

Additional features, such as statistics, will be coming in the future.

Labbie was written to use on the Windows operating system, so YMMV if you choose to try with other operating systems (and I don't currently have plans to produce releases for other operating systems).

## Support
Labbie requires me to host the enchant data myself, which I am doing out of my pocket. If you use the tool and love it, please consider a small donation through [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=4QXG9CPFYF5UJ) or become a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bnorick).
